- ✅ Pay only for actual usage
- ✅ Built-in high availability

### Why DynamoDB?
- ✅ Single-digit millisecond latency
- ✅ Automatic scaling
- ✅ Native stream support for events
- ✅ On-demand pricing (no capacity planning)

### Why Event-Driven Architecture?
- ✅ Loose coupling between services
- ✅ Asynchronous processing
- ✅ Better fault tolerance
- ✅ Easier to scale individual components
